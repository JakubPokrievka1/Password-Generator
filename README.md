This is my Python script meant to generate random passwords. 

This Python script is meant serve as my attempt to generate a utility to solve my issues of needing to create strong, long and complex passwords for websites that need passwords.

On Linux, the script is the easiest to be executed via the terminal, using either the "python3 passwordgenerator.py" or "./passwordgenerator.py" command.
However, this script can be ran in a IDE of your choice on Linux if you wish to do so. 

On Windows/MacOS, the Python script is best ran in a IDE.
